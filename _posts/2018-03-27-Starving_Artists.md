So this was something I was thinking about the other week and been seeing a ton since (maybe just some good old Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon) was people asking artists to do things for free and their payment being "exposure". This has always been a joke around the Internet on places like DeviantArt and some subreddits for art, that you can't eat exposure and exposure doesn't pay the bills.

I've always thought it was just a joke and that it doesn't really ever happen, but then I found this twitter account called [_For Exposure_](https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt) and it has a _ton_ of screenshots from random places where people basically call artists of any medium selfish and evil for charging high, but fair amounts for their work.

My favorite one is this one:

I will destroy your business.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/SwERjETSih">pic.twitter.com/SwERjETSih</a></p>&mdash; For Exposure (@forexposure_txt) <a href="https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt/status/978412117916237825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2018</a></blockquote>

For some reason people seem to think that art is just a bunch of paint on a canvas or something like that. The only value of it is the medium it's made out of. Kinda weird to me. There's also a few tweets about how all software is actually worthless because it's not actually anything physical, which completely blows my mind, but maybe I'm just not smart enough to think on the elevated plane these people do.

My mom is an artist and taught art for a while, and I can totally see her bitching somebody out about how her work only worth the $19.99 the canvas was.

Oh well, guess the higher thinking these people are on isn't meant for mortals like me.
