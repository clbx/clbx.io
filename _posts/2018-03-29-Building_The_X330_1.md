For my daily driver laptop I use a Thinkpad X230. For anyone familiar with Thinkpads they know that it's a rather old machine, its coming up on it's 7th birthday (yeah it could be a first grader). Despite it's age it's considered the last of the 'original' Thinkpads. It still holds the same design as the thinkpads of old minus the chicklet keyboard (but we'll get to that eventually).

So I have a X230, why the hell am I talking about a X330? Well there is no X330, at least not offcially. The X230 has many community created modifications and hacks to make it into a much cooler and more viable machine. This includes a mod that hooks on the the motherboard that allows for a higher resolution screen.

I'm upgrading the display from a 12.5" 1366x768 to a 13.3" 1920x1080. This is kinda a big undertaking here's why:


The way that the X230 connects to the screen from the factory is using a protocol called LVDS. LVDS is a pretty old protocol dervied from the Macintosh in 1992. So it's pretty old and back in the early 90's 1366x768 was a massive resolution and also happens to be the highest 16:9 screen resolution a single LVDS connector supports. So were SOL? Nope. The X230 has a dock that carries a bunch of Display Port lines. Using this board:

We can create a link to a display using the display ports from the dock. Unfortunately that particular board is made by a guy in Russia who only occasionally takes orders. We have another way though, the Chinese of course. There is a board on the Chinese website taobao, that had a similar board. It has more functionality but nukes the ability to use the dock (which is okay cause I don't use it anyway). It adds in another sata connection and some more USB ports.

So we have the new resolution taken care of, so now for the new screen size. There are a few 13.3" screens that will fit into the X230 chassis. All I need is a new custom bezel (also ordered from taobao), some careful dremel work on the lid, and moving around some wifi antenna's to make that a reality.


I'm currently in the process of getting everything from taobao, I have to use a Chinese agent service to actually get it, but I'm working on it.

I hope this works
