This is going to be something of a new venture for me. Getting back into actual web development. I worked with node a lot last summer, but didn't really like it. This clbx2.0 is my way of getting back into web dev and trying some new things. I'm really not a huge fan of the way most web devleopment works. Not a fan of the countless frameworks, and of course the famous dependancy hell that node has.



Oh well guess we'll find out.


In addition to that, since I'm writing these posts using markdown, I'm interested to see how Jekyll handles certain aspects of markdown


# first we have our headers

## smaller

### smaller

#### might as well use bold now

**speaking of bold**

*lets get fancy with it*

1. lets
2. make
3. a
4. list

* another?
* but there's no numbers!
* how will we ever know the order!


*just dont be stupid*

```c
	if(code_needed){
		printf("We use the code brackets");
	}
	else{
		printf("You don't");
	}
```

uh so some weird things. but i suppose putting markdown into html can't always be perfect.  The lists are messed up due to some of my css.
Definitely never using the code brackets. My font (its called GohuFont btw) is better than whatever is used there. might be able to change it, but I think my css is messing with it as well. Not a huge deal, the big stuff works. Like Dwight.

oh and the question marks are upside down. Thats kinda weird.
