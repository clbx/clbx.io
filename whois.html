			Hi, I'm Clay.<br><br>

			Im an American college student, studying Computer Engineering. I try to tell myself I write good code, and enjoy using linux. Im what you'd call a 'ricer'
			meaning I enjoy tweaking and making my setup look neat (arch+i3wm ftw) below is a picture of my previous rice, I'm still working on my new one.

			<br>You can check out my dotfiles on my <u><a href="https://github.com/clbx/dotfiles">Github Repository</a></u>

			<br><br>Im all about <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source code</a></u> and a huge supporter of the <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix Philosophy</a></u>
			I enjoy programming and basically anything computer related. I enjoy writing tiny useless scripts (my linux build is full of them) and while I'd like to take on
			some big projects, I rarely have the time, and when I do, I'm usually pretty burnt out from all my school projects.
			<br><br>My current big project is a machine learning mood(sorta) detector using a <u><a href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">Muse brainwave sensor</u></a>	called <u><a href="https://github.com/clbx/BrainLearn">BrainLearn</u></a>
			It's still in the data collection phase, but that should change shortly.

			<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, browsing reddit which I moderate a few subs, the most notable being a <u><a href="http://reddit.com/r/unixporn">poorly named sub for sharing cool *nix setups</u></a> When I was younger I throughly enjoyed art and drawing comics, something which I have thought about picking up again, (probably to the tune of XKCD).
			And of course spending time with my friends and family.

			That's me, there's not else a whole lot here except for my kinda lame blog. So yeah, enjoy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
