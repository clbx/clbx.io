			Hi, I'm Clay.<br>

			Im an American college student, studying Computer Engineering. I try to tell myself I write good code, and enjoy using linux.
			To the sides (maybe not yet, im still working on this site) are some projects im working on/have worked on. I can't share most of my good code
			due to NDA reasons, but here are some of my better things. I use Linux as much as possible (Windows is basically only for games at this point and you can find me on steam <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/Claythegreat">here</a>.
			Im an <a href="">Arch Linux</a>user, I like my OS how I made it. This also correlates with my choise of using <a href="">i3wm</a> which is an easily modifiable window manager with an emphasis on simplicity. Im a strong believer in
			open source and the <a href="">Unix Philosophy</a>.
			<br>
			Thanks, Clay.
