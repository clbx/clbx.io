     I'm Clay<br>
     I'm a 19 year old Student from Collegeville, PA currently studyig at
     Elizabethtown College. I've always been interested in computers and anything to do with them
		 I learned HTML at age 9 and took off with programming since then<
		 Although I lost interest in it through most of High School, during my senior year
		 I came back to the world of computing. Since then I have become very interested
		 In systems administration and Linux in particular. Although my main machine
		 does not run Linux, on my secondary machine I run Antergos Linux with the i3wm which
		 I have found to be a much better enviroment than anything MacOS or Windows could provide
		 I am currently looking for internships in either the world of IT and Systems Administration

	 Thanks, Clay
